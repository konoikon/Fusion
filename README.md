# Fusion

## Project Description

Fusion is one of the most awesome projects I have thought of until now. It is going to combine two of the most influential parts of my life both of which I am very passionate about: music and programming.

During the summer I was exposed more and more to electronic music and DJs. A big part of their job is transitioning between songs. The way transitioning works currently is by overlapping two songs, letting them play at the same time for a while, and then isolate the song you want to play next.

That is where Fusion comes in. Fusion will be able to create a unique piece of music according to the two songs that need to be connected. The piece of music will be the mathematically perfect transition between those two songs. The end goal is for a DJ to play song A, followed by the fusion, followed by song B and the experience to be seamless.

## Implementation

I do not know how to implement this project. But I will find out.
